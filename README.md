# VendingMachineSimulator

A Python project showcasing my expertise in object-oriented programming (SOLID principles) and modern software development practices. Emulate the operation of drink vending machines, demonstrating clean code architecture, encapsulation, and adherence to SOLID principles. Explore the codebase to witness the implementation of Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) practices for a seamless development experience.
