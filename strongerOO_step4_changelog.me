# Major changes in this strongerOO step 4 commit

## Module VendorMachineSimulator

# Classes VendingMachineOperations and VendingMachineMaintenance: Removed
their associated methods will be adapted to integrate as functions
into a revised version vending_machine_simulator_app

This "downgrading" is essentially due to the fact that these classes heavily interacts
 will other classes disrupting the "encapsulation" approach of strongerOO branch.

 Each solution proposed by Thierry Parmentalat (FUN/Mooc) were clunky

# Class VendingMachineFinancials: Created
This new class is responsible for all related financial revenue and future statistics reporting


## Unittest Test Files
As the class VendingMachineOperations were removed associated test files
test_vending_machines_operations and test_check_availability were abandoned and not committed

New test_vending_machine_financials was created and execution was successful
